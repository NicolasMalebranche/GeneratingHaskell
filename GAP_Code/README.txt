These are numerical results mentioned in the article.

The results can be computed (on GAP system) by running the code in the file
ComputeSmith.txt
applied to one matrix of the following:


The matrices from Proposition 2.2 are given by the files:
GAP_n=2_22.txt
GAP_n=3_22.txt
GAP_n=4_22.txt

The matrices from Proposition 2.4 are given by the files:
GAP_n=2_Sym3.txt
GAP_n=3_Sym3.txt
GAP_n=4_Sym3.txt

The matrices from Proposition 2.5 are given by the files:
GAP_n=3_24.txt
GAP_n=4_24.txt
GAP_n=5_24.txt

The matrices are such that the columns correspond to the vectors in the denominators.
